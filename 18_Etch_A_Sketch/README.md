This project uses Python’s built-in `turtle` graphics module to simulate a simple Etch-A-Sketch drawing toy. Users can control the turtle's movement using the keyboard to draw on the screen.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Practice using event listeners and key bindings in Python.
- Build an interactive drawing interface using turtle graphics.
- Reinforce concepts of callbacks and directional control.

## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced

- `turtle.Turtle()` and turtle screen setup
- Function definition and event-driven programming
- `onkey()` and `listen()` methods for keyboard input
- `clear()`, `home()`, and movement commands (`forward`, `backward`, `left`, `right`)

## 🎮 Controls

- `W` – Move forward  
- `S` – Move backward  
- `A` – Turn left  
- `D` – Turn right  
- `C` – Clear drawing and reset position

## 📋 How It Works

- Initializes a turtle on screen
- Listens for specific key presses
- Executes movement functions or resets screen based on input
- Uses function callbacks with `onkey()` for smooth interactivity

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

A turtle graphics window will open. Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to draw and `C` to clear the screen. Click anywhere to exit.

Have fun sketching with your keyboard! ✏️🐢
