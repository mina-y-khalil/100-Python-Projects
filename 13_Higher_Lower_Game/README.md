This Python project challenges users to guess which celebrity or brand has more followers on social media. It's a great project to practice comparison logic, randomness, and score tracking â€” all in a fun quiz format.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

- Practice working with dictionaries and nested data.
- Use randomization and logic to build a repeatable game loop.
- Learn comparison operations and conditional feedback.

## ðŸ§  Python Concepts Practiced

- Importing and using external modules (`logo`, `vs`, and `data`)
- `random.choice()` for selecting random items from a list
- Conditional logic and comparisons
- Function definition and return values
- Loops (`while`) for continuous gameplay
- Score tracking

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Randomly selects two accounts to compare.
- Each account shows name, description, and country.
- Asks the user to guess which has more followers.
- Continues until the user makes a wrong guess.
- Keeps and displays the current score.

## ðŸ›  How to Run

Ensure the following files are present:

- `art.py` (includes `logo` and `vs` ASCII art)
- `game_data.py` (includes the list `data` with follower stats)

Then run:

```bash
python higher_lower_game.py
