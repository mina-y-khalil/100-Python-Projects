## 📘 Course Attribution

These projects were developed during my applied study in:  
🎓 **_“The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp” by [Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) – [London App Brewery](https://github.com/appbrewery)_**

The course provided the overall structure, but each implementation in this repository is fully written by me.  
I've modified, extended, and optimized many of the original concepts to reinforce real-world problem-solving and software engineering principles.
