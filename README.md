## 📘 Course Attribution

These projects were developed during my applied study in:  
🎓 **_“The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp” by [Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) – [London App Brewery](https://github.com/appbrewery)_**
The course provided structure and guidance, but each implementation is my own. I’ve modified, extended, and refactored many of them to strengthen my understanding and prepare for real-world scenarios.
