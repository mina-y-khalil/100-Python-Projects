</p>

This Python program simulates a fun turtle race using the `turtle` graphics module. The user places a bet on which colored turtle will win, then watches the race unfold randomly.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Practice working with Turtle graphics and screen manipulation.
- Learn to handle user input and control flow in interactive programs.
- Use basic OOP concepts with the Turtle class.

## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced

- `turtle.Turtle()` for visual animation
- `Screen().textinput()` for capturing user input
- Lists and loops to manage multiple turtles
- Conditional logic for winner detection
- `random.randint()` for unpredictable movement

## 🎮 How It Works

1. A screen opens with 5 colored turtles lined up at the start.
2. The user places a bet by choosing a turtle color.
3. Each turtle moves forward randomly in a loop.
4. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
5. The result is printed based on whether the user's bet was correct.

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

- Choose a turtle color when prompted.
- Watch the race unfold!
- Click on the window to close the screen after the race ends.

Let the best turtle win! 🏁🐢
