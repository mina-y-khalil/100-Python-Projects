# ðŸŽ¢ Roller Coaster Ticket Program

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a ticketing system for a roller coaster ride. It calculates the ticket price based on the user's height and age, and gives the option to add a souvenir photo.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

- Practice **conditional statements** and **nested if-else** logic.
- Use **input()** to interact with the user.
- Demonstrate basic **math operations** and **string formatting**.

## ðŸ§  Python Concepts Practiced

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Nested conditional logic
- `input()` function for user input
- Type casting with `int()`
- String formatting using `f-strings`
- Basic arithmetic operations (`+`)

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Asks user for height and age.
- Restricts access if user is too short (under 120cm).
- Calculates ticket price based on age group:
  - Child (â‰¤ 12 years): $10
  - Youth (â‰¤ 18 years): $20
  - Adult (> 18 years): $25
- Offers a photo option for an extra $3.

## ðŸ›  How to Run

Run the Python script in any terminal or code editor:

```bash
