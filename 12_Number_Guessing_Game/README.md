This Python project is an interactive number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. The player selects a difficulty level and gets a limited number of attempts to win.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

- Practice working with functions and parameters.
- Learn control flow and state tracking through loops and conditionals.
- Gain experience with random number generation.

## ðŸ§  Python Concepts Practiced

- `import` and `from ... import` for modules
- Random number generation using `randint()`
- Function creation and return values
- Conditional logic (`if-elif-else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Global constants and difficulty settings

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- Lets user choose between 'easy' (10 guesses) or 'hard' (5 guesses).
- Provides feedback after each guess ("Too high", "Too low").
- Tracks and displays remaining attempts.
- Ends the game when the correct number is guessed or attempts run out.

## ðŸ›  How to Run

Ensure your `art.py` file contains a `logo` variable with ASCII art.

Then run:

```bash
python number_guessing_game.py
