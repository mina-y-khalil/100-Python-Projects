This Python project implements a simple Caesar cipher tool that allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting letters by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Practice working with lists and string indexing.
- Build an interactive text encryption and decryption program.
- Use modular arithmetic to handle wrap-around in the alphabet.

## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced

- `input()` for interactive user input
- String manipulation and concatenation
- `for` loops and `if-else` conditional logic
- List indexing and the `index()` method
- Modular arithmetic with `%`
- Function definition and arguments
- While loops to allow repeated use

## 📋 Features

- User chooses between encoding and decoding a message.
- Shifts each letter by the user-specified amount.
- Preserves non-letter characters (punctuation, spaces).
- Allows the user to repeat the process or exit.

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
