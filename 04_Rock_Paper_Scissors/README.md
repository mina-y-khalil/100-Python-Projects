# ✊ Rock, ✋ Paper, ✌️ Scissors Game

This Python project is a console-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. ASCII art is used to enhance the visual experience. Great for beginners to practice conditional logic and randomization.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Practice using lists and conditionals.
- Work with `random` for generating unpredictable outcomes.
- Display multi-line strings (ASCII art) for fun visual output.

## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced

- `input()` for user interaction
- `int()` for type conversion
- `if-elif-else` conditional logic
- `random.randint()` for random selection
- Lists for storing ASCII images
- Comparison operations

## 📋 Features

- User selects Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
- Computer randomly selects its move.
- Both choices are displayed with ASCII art.
- Game determines the winner based on classic rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- Invalid input results in automatic loss.
