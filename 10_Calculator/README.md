This Python project is a flexible calculator app that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It lets users continuously chain calculations using previous results â€” perfect for practicing functions, loops, and dynamic operation selection.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

- Practice defining and calling functions.
- Use a dictionary to map operators to logic.
- Learn how to accumulate results over multiple steps.

## ðŸ§  Python Concepts Practiced

- Function definitions with `def`
- Dictionary mapping of symbols to functions
- `while` loops for chaining logic
- Recursive function call for restarting
- `input()` and `float()` for user input handling

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operations.
- Displays available operations to the user.
- Chains calculations using previous result.
- Allows restarting from scratch without restarting the script.

## ðŸ›  How to Run

Ensure your `art.py` file contains the ASCII `logo` variable.

Then run:

```bash
python calculator.py
